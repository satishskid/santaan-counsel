    "explanation": "Egg freezing preserves YOUR eggs at current age/quality for future use. Best before age 35 (egg quality peaks). Process: Stimulation (10-14 days) → Retrieval → Freeze. Use them later for IVF when you're ready for baby. No expiration date!",

    "greeting": "Hi {{patient_name}}, thank you for coming in to discuss egg freezing.",
    "context": "Let me walk you through what egg freezing entails and whether it's right for you.",
    "explanation": "[CLEAR EXPLANATION] Egg freezing is essentially the first half of IVF - we stimulate your ovaries with hormones to grow multiple eggs, retrieve them through a minor procedure, and then freeze them using a flash-freezing technique called vitrification. The eggs stay frozen indefinitely - 10 years, 20 years, as long as needed. When you're ready to have a baby, we thaw the eggs, fertilize them with sperm, grow embryos, and transfer one to your uterus. [PAUSE] The key is to freeze eggs while you're young - ideally under 35 - because egg quality declines with age. If you freeze at 32 and use them at 40, those are still 32-year-old eggs, not 40-year-old eggs.",
    "next_steps": "Here's what we need to do next: First, blood test for AMH to check your ovarian reserve - how many eggs you have. Second, a baseline ultrasound to count your follicles. This tells us how many eggs we might get per cycle. Based on your age {{patient_age}}, I'd recommend freezing {{recommended_egg_count}} eggs total for a good chance of future pregnancy. That might mean {{cycle_count}} retrieval cycles.",
    "reassurance": "[EMPATHY] I know this feels like a big decision - you're planning for a future baby that might not exist yet. But many of my patients say freezing eggs gave them peace of mind. It removes the biological clock pressure. You can focus on career, travel, finding the right partner - whatever you need - knowing your fertility is preserved.",
    "call_to_action": "Think it over, discuss with family if that helps. No rush on the decision, but the sooner you freeze, the better the egg quality. When you're ready, we'll schedule the AMH test and get started.",
    "contact_info": "Any questions for me now? [WAIT] You can reach me at {{clinic_phone}} anytime."

    "explanation": "At age {{patient_age}}, AMH {{amh_value}} means you have good egg quantity. Expected retrieval: {{estimated_eggs}} eggs per cycle. For optimal future success, aim to freeze {{target_egg_count}} eggs total = {{cycle_count}} cycle(s).",

    "context": "[GENTLE TONE] Your AMH came back at {{amh_value}}, which is lower than we'd like for your age.",
    "explanation": "[HONEST] AMH below 1.0 means diminished ovarian reserve - fewer eggs remaining. For egg freezing, this presents a challenge. In one cycle, we might only retrieve {{estimated_eggs}} eggs, and not all will be mature. To bank a reasonable number like {{target_egg_count}} eggs, you'd likely need {{cycle_count}} cycles, which gets expensive. [PAUSE]",
    "next_steps": "[OPTIONS] Here are your options: 1) Proceed with egg freezing anyway - at least freeze what you can. 2) Aggressively stimulate and do back-to-back cycles quickly. 3) Consider that if you're planning to have a baby in the next 2-3 years anyway, it might make more sense to try naturally or do IVF now rather than freeze. 4) Accept that egg freezing may not be cost-effective and focus on other paths like donor eggs in future if needed.",
    "reassurance": "[EMPATHY] I'm sorry this isn't the news you were hoping for. Low AMH at {{patient_age}} isn't uncommon, but it does mean your biological clock is ticking faster. The good news is AMH doesn't predict egg QUALITY, only quantity. You might get fewer eggs, but they could still be good quality.",
    "call_to_action": "Take time to think about what makes sense for you - financially and life-planning wise. We can move forward with freezing if you want, but I want you to have realistic expectations about the numbers.",
