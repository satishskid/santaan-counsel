    "explanation": "Your hCG level is {{beta_value}}, which is a really good number for {{days_post_iui}} days after the IUI procedure. [PAUSE] This means the sperm successfully fertilized the egg and it implanted in your uterus. [EMPATHY] I know you've been waiting for this moment.",
    "next_steps": "[CLEAR] Here's what happens next: You'll need to come back in 48 hours for a repeat beta test on {{next_beta_date}}. We expect the number to roughly double - that's how we confirm the pregnancy is progressing well. Keep taking ALL your medications, especially progesterone - don't stop anything yet. Your first ultrasound will be around 6 weeks to confirm the heartbeat.",
    "reassurance": "[GENTLE TONE] I'm thrilled for you, but I also want to set realistic expectations. Early pregnancy is a sensitive time. Some light spotting is normal, but if you have heavy bleeding or severe cramping, call us right away. [PAUSE] The vast majority of IUI pregnancies that start with good beta numbers like yours go on to be healthy babies.",

    "explanation": "Your hCG level was {{beta_value}}, which is below the threshold for pregnancy (we need >5). [EMPATHY] This means the IUI cycle didn't result in pregnancy this time. I know this isn't the news you were hoping for, and I'm truly sorry.",
    "next_steps": "[CLEAR] You can stop taking progesterone and any other medications. Your period should start within the next week. [PAUSE] When it does, call us on Day 1 if you want to try another IUI cycle. There's no required waiting period - you can start right away if you're ready.",
    "reassurance": "[EMPATHY] I know this is devastating. [PAUSE] But please don't lose hope - the success rate for IUI is 10-20% per cycle, which means most people need 3-4 attempts. Your body responded well to the medications (good follicle count: {{follicle_count}}), so there's no reason to think it won't work next time. Some people just need multiple tries.",
    "call_to_action": "Take time to grieve this loss - it's real, even though the pregnancy never developed. [GENTLE TONE] When you're ready, we can discuss next steps: try IUI again, adjust medications, or consider moving to IVF if you've had multiple failed IUIs. No pressure - take the time you need.",

IVF better if: Age >35, Low sperm count, Blocked tubes, Endometriosis, >3-4 failed IUIs. IUI cheaper (\u20b915-20K) but lower success. IVF expensive (\u20b91.5-2L) but higher success = fewer cycles needed.",
    "next_steps": "Options: 1) Try 1-2 more IUI cycles (if young + no other issues). 2) Move to IVF now (recommended if >35 or other factors). 3) Take break, decide later. Consult with Dr. {{doctor_name}} to review case.",

    "context": "[EMPATHETIC] You've completed {{iui_attempts}} IUI cycles without success. I know that's been really hard.",
    "explanation": "[CLEAR] Let me explain the statistics. IUI has about a 10-20% success rate per cycle. After {{iui_attempts}} attempts, the cumulative odds of it working are actually declining. [PAUSE] IVF, on the other hand, has a 40-60% success rate per cycle depending on age and other factors. It's significantly higher. [HONEST] Now, IVF costs more - around \u20b91.5-2 lakhs per cycle versus \u20b915-20K for IUI. But if you need 6 IUI cycles to get the same chance as 2 IVF cycles, the math actually favors IVF in the long run.",
    "next_steps": "[OPTIONS] Here are your choices: First, you could try 1-2 more IUI cycles if you're under 35 and there are no other issues - some people do succeed on attempt 4 or 5. Second, you could move to IVF now, which is what I'd recommend if you're over 35, have low sperm parameters, or have tried IUI 3+ times. Third, you could take a break and decide later - there's no rush if you need time emotionally or financially.",
    "reassurance": "[EMPATHY] Failed IUIs absolutely do not mean you can't get pregnant. IVF gives us much more control - we can see the eggs, watch them fertilize, choose the best embryos, and place them directly in the uterus. Many patients who fail IUI succeed on their first or second IVF cycle. You're not a failure - sometimes the method just needs to be more aggressive.",
    "call_to_action": "I'd like to schedule an IVF consultation for you - no obligation, just to give you all the information about costs, timeline, and your specific success odds. Then you can make an informed decision. Does that sound okay?",
