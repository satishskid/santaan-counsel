    "greeting": "Hi {{patient_name}}, thank you for coming in to discuss egg freezing.",
    "context": "Let me walk you through what egg freezing entails and whether it's right for you.",
    "explanation": "[CLEAR EXPLANATION] Egg freezing is essentially the first half of IVF - we stimulate your ovaries with hormones to grow multiple eggs, retrieve them through a minor procedure, and then freeze them using a flash-freezing technique called vitrification. The eggs stay frozen indefinitely - 10 years, 20 years, as long as needed. When you're ready to have a baby, we thaw the eggs, fertilize them with sperm, grow embryos, and transfer one to your uterus. [PAUSE] The key is to freeze eggs while you're young - ideally under 35 - because egg quality declines with age. If you freeze at 32 and use them at 40, those are still 32-year-old eggs, not 40-year-old eggs.",
    "next_steps": "Here's what we need to do next: First, blood test for AMH to check your ovarian reserve - how many eggs you have. Second, a baseline ultrasound to count your follicles. This tells us how many eggs we might get per cycle. Based on your age {{patient_age}}, I'd recommend freezing {{recommended_egg_count}} eggs total for a good chance of future pregnancy. That might mean {{cycle_count}} retrieval cycles.",
    "reassurance": "[EMPATHY] I know this feels like a big decision - you're planning for a future baby that might not exist yet. But many of my patients say freezing eggs gave them peace of mind. It removes the biological clock pressure. You can focus on career, travel, finding the right partner - whatever you need - knowing your fertility is preserved.",
    "call_to_action": "Think it over, discuss with family if that helps. No rush on the decision, but the sooner you freeze, the better the egg quality. When you're ready, we'll schedule the AMH test and get started.",

In one cycle, we might only retrieve {{estimated_eggs}} eggs, and not all will be mature. To bank a reasonable number like {{target_egg_count}} eggs, you'd likely need {{cycle_count}} cycles, which gets expensive. [PAUSE]",
    "next_steps": "[OPTIONS] Here are your options: 1) Proceed with egg freezing anyway - at least freeze what you can. 2) Aggressively stimulate and do back-to-back cycles quickly. 3) Consider that if you're planning to have a baby in the next 2-3 years anyway, it might make more sense to try naturally or do IVF now rather than freeze. 4) Accept that egg freezing may not be cost-effective and focus on other paths like donor eggs in future if needed.",
    "reassurance": "[EMPATHY] I'm sorry this isn't the news you were hoping for. Low AMH at {{patient_age}} isn't uncommon, but it does mean your biological clock is ticking faster. The good news is AMH doesn't predict egg QUALITY, only quantity. You might get fewer eggs, but they could still be good quality.",

    "explanation": "[DIRECT] At age {{patient_age}}, egg QUANTITY and QUALITY both decline significantly. Your AMH is {{amh_value}}, which means we might retrieve {{estimated_eggs}} eggs per cycle. But more importantly, at this age, a higher percentage of eggs have chromosomal abnormalities. Even if we freeze {{target_egg_count}} eggs, the success rate per egg is much lower than if you'd frozen them at 32. Realistically, you might need {{adjusted_target}} eggs to have a reasonable chance of one healthy baby. [PAUSE]",
    "next_steps": "[OPTIONS] Here are my recommendations: 1) If you're planning to try for a baby in the next 1-2 years, consider doing IVF NOW with fresh eggs and freezing any extra EMBRYOS instead of eggs - embryo freezing has better outcomes. 2) If you're not ready for a baby for 5+ years, egg freezing still makes sense as backup, but set realistic expectations - it's not a guarantee. 3) Consider that donor eggs might be part of your future plan regardless, given age-related quality decline.",
    "reassurance": "[EMPATHY] I'm not trying to discourage you - I just want you to make an informed decision with realistic expectations.

The embryos are likely fine (young eggs, good embryos), so the issue is probably implantation. Possible causes: Uterine polyps/fibroids we missed, adenomyosis, chronic endometritis (infection), immunological issues, thin lining, or displaced implantation window (ERA test).",
    "next_steps": "[TESTING PLAN] Before using more donor embryos, I recommend: 1) Hysteroscopy - look inside uterus for polyps/scarring. 2) Endometrial biopsy - test for chronic endometritis (treatable with antibiotics). 3) ERA test - check if we're transferring at the right time (maybe need more/less progesterone). 4) Immunology panel - test for blood clotting issues, autoimmune factors. 5) Maybe mock cycle with immunology protocol (steroids, blood thinners) before next real transfer.",

[PAUSE] I'm not a religious authority - I can't tell you what's 'allowed' in your faith. But I can tell you that many patients from conservative backgrounds have navigated this by consulting with progressive religious scholars, seeking fatwas or rabbinic opinions, or deciding that family-building is a personal medical decision between you and God.

    "explanation": "Despite retrieving {{total_eggs}} eggs and performing ICSI (injecting sperm directly), none of the eggs have fertilized normally to form embryos. This is called 'Total Fertilization Failure'. It is a rare occurrence (1-3% of cycles) usually caused by an activation issue within the egg or sperm that we couldn't see beforehand.",
    "next_steps": "This cycle will not result in a transfer. We need to investigate if 'Oocyte Activation' (calcium ionophore) can help in a future cycle, or analyze the sperm DNA fragmentation more deeply.",

    "explanation": "Aaj procedure mein humne dekha ki follicles toh the, par unme se eggs retrieve nahi huye. Isse 'Empty Follicle Syndrome' kehte hain. Sometimes trigger injection (HCG) body mein theek se absorb nahi hota, ya eggs follicle wall se detach nahi huye.",
    "next_steps": "Abhi ke liye aap medications stop kar dijiye. Period aane ka wait karein. Next cycle mein hum different trigger protocol use karenge to ensure eggs release hon.",
    "reassurance": "Ye bohot frustrating hai, I know. Par iska matlab ye nahi ki aapke paas eggs nahi hain. Ye aksar 'drug delivery' issue hota hai, egg reserve issue nahi. Next time protocol change se results better milne chahiye.",

    "explanation": "Your hCG levels are rising slowly, but we cannot see a gestational sac in the uterus. There is a strong suspicion of an 'Ectopic Pregnancy', where the embryo has implanted in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. This is a medical emergency because the tube can rupture.",
    "next_steps": "You need to come to the clinic NOW. We likely need to administer an injection called Methotrexate to stop the pregnancy from growing and protect your tube, or we may need laparoscopic surgery.",
